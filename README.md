#  GildedRoseProject

This project is based on the GildedRose refactoring kata from emilybache:

https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

Requirements of the assessment: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.txt

The goals of this repository is to show how to refactor the given code and add a new item as a feature. 

Steps I took: 
- Map out requirements and edge cases
- Add asked functionality to original logic. 
- Create unit tests to test these edge cases and requirements
- Refactor given logic code
- Retest unit tests and add code coverage where possible

The current code coverage is 97.2% because of the Item.description not being covered.
